## Two Sum (Easy)
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
### Example
Given: 
  ```python
  nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
  target = 9
  ```
  *nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9*
  ```python
  return [0, 1]
  ```
