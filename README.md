# Big Countries
There is a table World:

A country is big if it has an area of bigger than 3 million (3000000) square km or a population of more than 25 million (25000000).

Write a SQL solution to output big countries' **name**, **population** and **area**.

# Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Example:**

Input: x = 1, y = 4

1   (0 0 0 1)

4   (0 1 0 0)

Two bits differ. Therefore, the Output/Hamming distance is 2.

# Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

  ```python
  nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
  target = 9
  ```
  *nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9*
  ```python
  return [0, 1]
  ```
